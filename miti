Mitigation Strategies
To minimize instability:
Use Recommendation Mode: Set updateMode: "Off" or "Initial" to test recommendations without automatic evictions.
Set Strict Limits: Define CPU/memory limits in the deployment to constrain VPA adjustments.
Increase Node Capacity: Add nodes or use larger node types (e.g., Standard_D8s_v3) to handle spikes.
Throttle VPA Updates: Configure longer observation periods to reduce eviction frequency.
Monitor with Azure Monitor: Track evictions and Pending pods to identify instability.
