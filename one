AKS Capacity Reservation Groups (CRG) – Financial Services Scenarios
Executive One-Pager
December 2025
Business Problem in Financial Services
Financial workloads (e.g., trading platforms, risk modeling, payment processing) demand instant, uninterrupted compute for compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, SOX) and zero-tolerance SLAs. Azure capacity crunches—driven by surging AI/ML demand and supply-chain delays—can delay VM/AKS node provisioning by 15–90+ minutes, risking multimillion-dollar losses during peaks like market opens or quarter-ends. Official Azure Capacity Crunch Incidents:
2025 East US Shortfall (July): Multi-AZ VMSS issues for D/E-series SKUs; customers urged to migrate to AZ1/3 or East US 2. Microsoft Learn: Logical Zone Mapping
Ongoing 2025 Constraints: High demand blocks GPU/VM allocations in regions like North Central US; quota delays for ML endpoints. Q&A: Capacity Issues
Historical (2020–2024): COVID-era surges caused repeated allocation failures; Microsoft prioritized enterprises but new/pending users hit barriers. Azure Blog: Service Continuity
Troubleshooting Guide: AllocationFailed errors due to "unprecedented demand"; retry in alternate zones or use CRGs. Microsoft Learn: VM Allocation Failures
CRGs mitigate this by locking 100% guaranteed capacity for AKS manual node pools, ensuring no failures.
Short Summary of CRG
A Capacity Reservation Group (CRG) is an Azure resource that pre-reserves dedicated compute capacity (specific VM sizes and zones) for exclusive use by your VMs or AKS node pools. It guarantees 100% availability during high-demand periods, preventing allocation failures. Create via CLI/Portal/API within a group; attach to new manual AKS node pools using --crg-id. Ideal for finance's predictable peaks; billed hourly at pay-as-you-go rates (even unused), eligible for RI discounts.
Financial-Only Scenarios: 100% Guaranteed Compute with CRGs
CRGs shine in finance for predictable, high-stakes scaling. Target D/E/FX-series VMs for analytics/risk workloads. Combine with Reserved Instances for 72%+ savings.

Impact if No CRG (Real Crunch Risk)
Setup Notes
1
End-of-Quarter Financial Closing
Reserves 200+ E-series nodes for batch ETL/risk calcs; scales in <10 min without quota waits.
2025 US Central delays blocked ML jobs, delaying reports by hours. Q&A: VM Failures
Zonal CRG in East US; manual AKS pool + per-pool autoscaler.
2
Real-Time Trading Platforms
Locks FX-series for low-latency order execution; instant failover during volatility spikes.
East US 2025 crunch hit trading VMs, causing 15-min outages. Network World: East US Shortfall
HA across zones; taints for trading pods only.
3
Payment Gateways & Core Banking
Ensures D-series for transaction processing; zero downtime for 24/7 ops.
2020–2024 surges caused pinned cluster failures in banking VMs. Cloud Services Allocation
Multi-region CRGs for DR; PCI-compliant labeling.
CRG vs. Reserved Instances (RI) – Quick Comparison
CRGs focus on availability guarantees, while RIs emphasize cost discounts. Use them together for optimal results in financial workloads.
Feature
Capacity Reservation Group (CRG)
Reserved Instances (RI)
Primary Focus
100% capacity guarantee (no allocation failures)
Up to 72% billing discount on committed usage
Availability Protection
Yes—locks capacity; fails creation if unavailable
No—prioritized access only, no hard guarantee
Cost Savings
None inherent (pay-as-you-go rates apply)
Deep discounts (1/3-year terms)
Commitment
Flexible—no term; create/delete anytime
Fixed 1-year or 3-year commitment
Billing
Hourly for reserved capacity (even if unused)
Discount applied only to running resources
Finance Use Case
Trading platforms needing instant failover
Steady-state risk modeling for long-term savings
Best Combo
CRG + RI = Guarantee + Discount (e.g., 72% off reserved capacity)
N/A


Cost of CRGs
CRGs are billed hourly at the same rate as the underlying VM size (pay-as-you-go pricing), whether the reserved capacity is used or unused—e.g., reserving 10 Standard_D2s_v3 VMs charges as if 10 VMs are running, even idle. No upfront commitment required, but you pay for the full reserved amount continuously. Discounts from Reserved Instances or Savings Plans apply automatically to both used and unused portions, potentially zeroing out costs for covered capacity.  


Bottom Line for Finance Execs
CRGs provide contractual 100% allocation reliability today—essential for zero-downtime trading and compliance in crunch-prone regions. Pair with RIs for up to 72% savings; deploy via manual AKS pools now, and simplify with native NAP integration in 2026 to future-proof your financial workloads.
